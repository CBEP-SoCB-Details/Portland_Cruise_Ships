# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is
documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Organization
All CBEP 2020 State of the Bay data analysis repositories are divided into four
sub-folders.  Each subfolder contains data, code and analysis results as
follows:  

- Original Data.  Original data, with a "READ ME.TXT" file that documents data
  sources.  DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.
- Derived Data.  Data derived from the originaL RAW DATA.  Includes
  documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files
  (R notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via
  another markdown file.
- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the data
  analysis steps.
- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of related
  graphics, and also raw copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and
  \*.pdf formats.  These graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in
  final State of the Bay graphical layouts.

# Summary of Data Sources
All data are derived from data available from the City of Portland's website
(https://www.portlandmaine.gov/2012/Waterfront).  Data published in PDF format
were copied into Excel, where they were organized for analysis.

## Shiny App
For this dataset, we developed a simple Shiny App, which allows users to
look more closely at the structure of the data in various ways.
