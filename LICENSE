         Data on the Portland, Maine Cruise Ships schedule was not
         produced by CBEP. CBEP is not the copyright holder and cannot
         grant useage rights to others. The data was released through a City of
         Portland municipal website
         (https://www.portlandmaine.gov/2012/Waterfront ) and thus is thought to
         be in the public domain.
